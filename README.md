## Demo
[demo](https://funmapzzzwithcomma-735b8mx1a9.netlify.com)

folders are:
- map (main for visual map display, created with create-react-app)
- bash_tools (bash scripts i used to wrangle and explore data a little)
- server (half implemented api server for bonus fun)


## Bonus
- quarter implemented cursoring api in `/server` - good for case when not all data is here
- quarter implemented server-sent events api in `/server` - could be good for live data events


## Things I wish I could've done w more time
- interpolate the cubehelix color across each path for better path differentiation.
- implement downsampling on the data (see utils folder) for better chart performance.
- implement interpolation or future prediction on speed.
- complete the server-sent events streaming api for use case of live data map dashboard.
- probably swap out chartjs for a d3-based solution to unify charting.
- proptypes
- more robust throttling
